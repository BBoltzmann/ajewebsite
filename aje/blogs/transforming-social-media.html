Did you know that the social-commerce market is expected to surpass $2 trillion by 2025? Many people are still discovering what social commerce is all about. To put it simply, social commerce is the use of social media platforms to promote and sell products or services. This includes features like shoppable posts on Instagram, Facebook Marketplace, Pinterest's Buyable Pins, and influencer promotions across various platforms.

<aside>ðŸ’¡ But there's a challenge: social media wasn't initially designed for commerce. If it were, it probably wouldn't have a homepage.</aside>

Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter were built as digital extensions of our personal spaces. They function like virtual homes where we're selective about who we invite in. The 'follow' button symbolizes this invitation, granting others access to our personal online abode. This setup creates an atmosphere of familiarity and exclusivity, much like a living room filled with friends and family.

However, introducing commerce into this home setup can be complex. Unlike markets, where transactions are the norm, commerce within the confines of a home can feel intrusive and out of place. Markets, specifically designed for trade, operate on the principle of openness. Anyone can visit a market, browse through wares, and engage in transactions without the need for personal invitations or connections.

Transposing this market dynamic onto social media disrupts the platform's original purpose. When users scroll through their feeds, expecting personal updates or content from their chosen influencers, encountering blatant commercial content can be jarring. It's akin to having a salesperson walk into your living room uninvited.

This is where AjÃ©, the first social marketplace application, comes into play. The idea is simple: social commerce is best conducted on social markets rather than on social media. AjÃ© seamlessly integrates commerce into the social experience while incorporating essential features like escrow services and alternative dispute resolution. It creates a space where users can explore products and services in a way that feels natural and non-intrusive. Just as influencers expertly host their followers, AjÃ© lets users discover, engage, and transact within a familiar and comfortable digital environment. We've replaced the "Home" button with the "Market" to signify that people won't just follow you; they'll know how many secure trades you've completed, with our advanced escrow and dispute resolution system ensuring a safe and trustworthy shopping experience.Did you know that the social-commerce market is expected to surpass $2 trillion by 2025?
